"Truly the Best Historical Museum","On a rainy day in London, we chose to return to the British Museum and were not, and have never been, disappointed. I have visited many historically focused museums in the world and this to me is the best. The British started collecting earlier than most countries so they…","June 2019","orth1","Jun 2019",5
"Went for the Egyptian display - well worth it ","We decided to pay a visit as the 8yo is studying the Egyptians at school.  She was very happy to see the Rosetta Stone (quite popular, it can take a while to get to the front if it’s very busy), and the mummies.  The display in the mummies section was amazing, we read everything…","June 2019","tufttufttuft","Jun 2019",4
"I saw the rossetta stone! ","Firstly, I can't believe the museums in England are free! Such a huge place, and it's really a tribute to England's ability to ""borrow"" artifacts from all over the world, back when that was a thing. Such an amazing collection from all over the world. Additionally the Cafe was…","May 2019","paula","Jun 2019",4
"Fantastic museum","Great museum with decent exhibitions and a very large Greek and Roman section. Eat before you go because the cafes are expensive, and go early to avoid the queues. ","May 2019","Andy H","Jun 2019",4
"What a Surprise - Fantastic","On a long weekend in London this was the nicest Dinner and meal we had. We booked, which I would recomend, and the hours are not late. The service is freindly and efficient the food is excellent (we both had the chicken) and the deserts wonderful. Combine this with very…","June 2019","Jeff N","Jun 2019",5
"Amazing Place","Apart from the fact one needs at least a full week to appreciate all that is here, it was a remarkable set of exhibits.  We appreciated the maintenance and upgrades of the Egyptian exhibits","March 2019","Tovah W","Jun 2019",5
"Wonderful Museum","There was so much to see. You didn't know which way to turn as it was full of amazing objects. We will have to revisit as we ran out of time.","June 2019","christine d","Jun 2019",5

"Take the 90 minute highlights tour","This tour gives you a clear and concise view of the museum, which is overwhelming in its collection and sheer size. Keeps it manageable and understandable. The restaurant in the center has delicious food also!","June 2019","Betsymh","Jun 2019",5
"Best cultural value in the world!","Wow.  Even crowded with lots of running school children, this place is a treasure. We spent two different afternoons here and still didn’t see it all. ","May 2019","ejcrowe","Jun 2019",5
"Fabulous for those who like ancient history.","Track the evolution of civilisation, the start of cities, the start and evolution of customs such as burials, from the middle East, Egypt, Africa and Europe.

"Wonderful Museum","This is a wonderful museum to visit and holds many of the world's treasures. Be prepared to be mobbed as the crowds are quite heavy. The price is well worth it...free. :)","June 2019","Eric P","Jun 2019",5
"Awe Inspiring","The great domed entryway is simply stunning! It’s worth it just to see that- go early and though museum technically not ‘opened’ until 10 am you can still enter the rotunda area to enjoy the light, architecture and plan your visit path before then. Start on the 3rd floor and…","June 2019","DocCho","Jun 2019",5
"Great museum","Great museum with wonderful artifacts.  If visiting in the summer, prepare for very warm rooms.  Most do not have air conditioning and get overly warm with the number of visitors.","May 2019","mdh1222","Jun 2019",4
"Waited a lifetime","This was a bucket list trip for me. Blocked out the entire day to spend here, and I did.  You can seriously get lost in this place, even with a map. ","May 2019","Kotek1985","Jun 2019",5
"A Top-3 History Museum in the World","This is a history museum that cannot be missed.  In fact, you may wish to visit a couple times (museum fatigue is very real), which isn't bad for your wallet because it's free.  Exhibits of ancient antiquities are only matched by a few other collections in Berlin, Cairo, and…","July 2018","Globepouncing","Jun 2019",5

"Encyclopaedic Museum","Stupendous!  Be prepared to spend a whole day there and not even come close to scratching the surface of the encyclopaedic collection.  Highly advise visiting on a Friday to maximize the time available on a single visit - and if possible, join the paid morning tours (30 pounds)…","May 2019","alvinofdiaspar","Jun 2019",5
"Not to be missed - one of the best museums!","Love this museum and is great for kids!  Don't miss the mummy selection, but there are also a lot of things to discover here.  They really have so many things to look at from all over the world.  It's free too!","May 2019","krhead","Jun 2019",5
"Lovely but to busy on the day we visited poor weather day.","We came here on a very wet day and I think everyone had the same idea because of the poor weather. The exhibits where well presented and wonderful to look at. I have an issue with how the crowds are controlled. Because it was very busy I seemed to get pushed around alot by other…","June 2019","Bethany A","Jun 2019",3
"Nice to spend the day. Free","Free admission.  Lots to see the world under one roof.  Easy in. Don’t need a formal tour just by $ 2 map. Need more than 4 hours to get to see. Many wonders of the world in there","June 2019","wburtt","Jun 2019",5
"Magnificent","The British museum remains one of my favourite museums and I have been world wide. Try to go to a lunchtime gallery talk which are free and fascinating to broaden your knowledge to areas maybe you haven’t looked into.

"Some amazing world class permanent exhibits","It's wonderful when passing by to take a few minutes to nip in and spectate upon some of the most impressive archaeological marvels.  Sometimes I will walk in just to look at and contemplate a single favourite item, and then leave.  It's such a privilege being able to get so…","May 2019","DoonsieFerreira","Jun 2019",5
"Not very welcoming","I haven't been in a little while. It's an unfortunate sign of the times, that entry is now through a dizzying long chicane of barriers that leads to a security check carried out in a very dour manner. Obviously, it's a serious thing and, sadly, a precaution that is necessary.…","June 2019","Rosetogo","Jun 2019",4
"Blows Away Any Other Museum You've Ever Been To","First of all its FREE!  The collections are vast and from all parts of the globe. Truly the world's museum. Its amazing and a ... maze.

"Plan extra time!","If you love museums, culture and history, ignore all the “suggested time to spend” recommendations for this museum. They are much, much too short. We spent 4.5 hours here, and only had time for 1 gallery, 1 short, free tour, and a quick lunch in the museum. That being said, we…","May 2019","Erin","Jun 2019",5
"Stunning structure, stunning collection","The British Museum is a stunning structure. It's so awe-inspiring merely to stand in it, especially in the Great Court area. The collection, too, is endless-- you could spend hours upon hours here. I spent five!   I found the audio guide very helpful, because listening to…","June 2019","M. Dawn","Jun 2019",5
"Great value with great items but...","Free is always great and the items inside are one of a kind.  That being said be ready to fight crowds for most of the best items and be prepared for drastic temperature changes between rooms.  Shorts and a short sleeve shirt recommended for most of the building except the gift…","June 2019","Matt H","Jun 2019",4
"Excellent Service","3 of us went to see the Leonardo Da Vinci, 'Mind in Motion' exhibition. We were told it was sold out but if we returned at 12 there might be a chance of returns.

"An amazing collection.","Whatever part of the ancient world you're interested in there's likely to be something of interest.
